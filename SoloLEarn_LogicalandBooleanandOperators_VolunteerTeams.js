// Logical or boolean operators


// Volunteers have been divided into 5 groups with equal number of members. 
// If any group has fewer than 5 people, more volunteers must be recruited to fill the empty spots.
// Write a program that takes the number of volunteers and outputs to the console 
// how many volunteers need to be hired to have 5 equal groups.

// Sample Input
// 24

// Sample Output
// 1

// Explanation
// The nearest number to 24 that is multiple of 5 is 25, so we need 1 more volunteer (24+1=25) to get 5 equal groups.
